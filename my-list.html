              <p>Most people around the world would shy away at the first sight of beans, 
                but Red Red is one dish that has managed to reignite the love of beans in many people. 
                Cooked into a fine bean curry that can include either a mix of prawns or fish. 
                It gets the red color from the red palm oil that they use to prepare the stew, 
                in most places it will also be prepared with tomato paste. 
                Red Red is one dish that demonstrates Ghanaian cuisine at its best.

            <h2>Waakye</h2>
            
            <p>Waakye (pronounced ‘waachay’) is a combination of red or black-eyed beans and rice, 
              and it’s often served with salads, spaghetti, fried plantains, garri, meat and fish. 
              It’s a delicacy all over the country, and Ghanaians frequently queue at stalls to buy it for their breakfast or lunch.
              <br>Waakye originated from northern Ghana, where rice and beans are staple food crops. However, it’s not clear which specific ethnic group is responsible for pioneering this national treasure. Depending on where it’s prepared, certain variations exist in its ingredients, like the ratio of rice to beans or the spiciness of the accompanying shitor (hot pepper sauce). Nevertheless, it manages to maintain a generally consistent taste.

            <h2>Jollof Rice</h2> 
            <p>The debate about whose Jollof Rice is better between Nigerians and Ghanaians usually 
              generate heated debate on any social media. While we are not here to open the can of worms, 
              suffice it to say that Jollof Rice is a popular dish in both countries.  
              Jollof rice has its origin in the Senega/Gambia axis of West Africa, 
              but it enjoys huge popularity across West Africa generally. 
              Jollof rice is made with rice, tomatoes, tomato paste, onions, scotch bonnet peppers, salt, spices and vegetable oil.</p>
